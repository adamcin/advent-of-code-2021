/// covered in chitons, and it would be best not to bump any of them.
///
/// The cavern is large, but has a very low ceiling, restricting your motion to two dimensions. 
/// The shape of the cavern resembles a square; a quick scan of chiton density produces a map of 
/// risk level throughout the cave (your puzzle input).

/// 1. google "path finding algorithms"
/// 2. find wiki for Dijkstra's algorithm. begin implementing.
/// 3. reach step where a priority queue is called for
/// 4. google "rust priority queue"
/// 5. land on docs.rust-lang.org page for BinaryHeap
/// 6. copy-paste entire example after reading: 
///    "This is a larger example that implements Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to solve the shortest
///     path problem on a directed graph. It shows how to use BinaryHeap with custom types."
